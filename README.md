# [Blues Wireless][blues]

The note-arduino Arduino library for communicating with Blues Wireless Notecard via serial or IÂ²C. Includes example sketches in the [](examples directory).

This library allows you to control a Notecard by writing an Arduino sketch in C or C++.
Your sketch may programmatically configure Notecard and send Notes to [Notehub.io][notehub].

This library is a wrapper around the [note-c library][note-c] library, which it includes as a git submodule.
