# [Blues Wireless][blues]

The note-arduino Arduino library for communicating with Blues Wireless Notecard via serial or IÂ²C. Includes example sketches in the [examples directory](examples).

This library allows you to control a Notecard by writing an Arduino sketch in C or C++.
Your sketch may programmatically configure Notecard and send Notes to [Notehub.io][notehub].

This library is a wrapper around the [note-c library][note-c] library, which it includes as a git submodule.

## Installation

1. Clone this library and its submodule from github into your Arduino libraries folder:
   ```
   git clone --recursive git@github.com:blues/note-arduino.git [PATH_TO_YOUR_ARDUINO_HOME_FOLDER]/libraries/note-arduino`
   ```
2. Start the Arduino IDE
3. Verify that the following items are available:
   ```
   File -> Examples -> Examples from Custom Libraries -> Blues Wireless Notecard -> 01-Requests
   Sketch -> Include library -> Contributed Libraries -> Blues Wireless Notecard
   ```
